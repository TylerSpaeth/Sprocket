# Sprocket
Sprocket is a framework for creating 2D games and applications developed in C++ with OpenGL as the rendering API. 
Currently, the framework only supports Windows, but in the future, support for other operating systems is possible.

## Usage
The Sprocket framework can be compiled as a .dll and there is an included Sprocket.h file to go along with it. 
To compile the library, use the CMakeList file included in the Sprocket directory.
Because this framework is still a work in progress, proper usage is subject to change. For now, view the Example directory to
see how to get a basic Sprocket application up and running.
